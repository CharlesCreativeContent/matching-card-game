With over 100 different cards, test your memory in these three popular trading card themes, Pokemon, Yugioh, & Magic: The Gathering!

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

My learning was focused on making a colorful and surprising UX for this application, to test whether the novel cards or the familiar cards are easier to match.

## Optimizations
When I improve this project, I would update my media queries and would focus on a mobile-first approach. I would then work on adding a timing feature and leaderboard

## Lessons Learned:

Don't forget to update the media queries to make sure everyone can see your content, rather than just the people that have a screen size like yours.
